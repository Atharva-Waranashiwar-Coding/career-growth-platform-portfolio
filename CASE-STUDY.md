## 2. Project Objectives
- Diagnose skill gaps via assessments and real user data
- Provide personalized, actionable learning paths with clear milestones
- Enable guided portfolio creation and public showcase
- Foster mentor connections with trust signals
- Track progress against clear goals with evidence of learning

---

## 3. User Research & Insights
**Methods**
- Stakeholder interviews: product leads and mentors to clarify platform goals
- Contextual interviews & diary studies (N=12): understand daily routines and pain points
- Quantitative analysis: analytics, funnels, and engagement behavior
- Competitive audit: LMSs, portfolios (Behance, Dribbble), mentorship platforms

**Key insights**
- Users rely on multiple tools and suffer high context-switching costs
- Recommendations are often generic; users want clear, actionable next steps
- Portfolio creation is unclear—users lack scaffolding for recruiter-focused content
- Mentor discovery needs trust signals (portfolio links, endorsements, match criteria)
- Progress metrics require a strong link to real outcomes and career goals

**Research Questions (callout)**
- How do users discover and prioritize skill gaps?
- What makes a learning recommendation feel relevant and achievable?
- How do users want to document and present work for recruiters?
- What are expectations for mentor discovery and interactions?
- Which progress metrics motivate ongoing engagement?
- How should navigation support discoverability while avoiding cognitive overload?

## 4. Design Approach & Usability Testing
**Approach (short paragraph)**: We implemented an iterative process focused on early validation. Starting with task analysis to identify friction points, we moved from low-fi to high-fi prototypes and used observation sessions and moderated usability tests to validate hypotheses and refine the UI.

**5-step timeline**
- Task analysis
- Low-fi ideation and sketches
- High-fi interactive prototypes
- UX observation / moderated sessions
- Synthesis and iteration cycles

**Testing Setup: 5 Core Tasks & Metrics**
1. Discover a skill gap – metrics: task success, time on task, perceived clarity
2. Start a recommended learning path – metrics: conversion, perceived relevance
3. Build a portfolio item – metrics: task completion, frustration points
4. Find and request a mentor – metrics: time-to-mentor, confidence in match
5. Check progress relative to a career goal – metrics: clarity of metrics, likelihood to continue

## 5. Early Design Screens & Design Decisions
**Layout:** Grid of five core flows (Skill Gap → Learning Path → Portfolio Builder → Mentor Connection → Progress Dashboard)

For each flow, present the following:
- [Before/After screen pair placeholder]
- Design Decision caption

**Flow examples:**
1. Skill Gaps: Before: Fragmented assessments across screens → After: Skill Gap Radar showing prioritized gaps + immediate first-step tasks
2. Learning Path: Before: Generic lists of courses → After: Personalized, milestone-based pathways with integrated micro-assignments
3. Portfolio: Before: Upload-only tools with limited scaffolding → After: Guided story templates and recruiter-focused prompts
4. Mentor Connection: Before: Generic browse/search → After: Trust signals, endorsements, and mutual interest tags
5. Progress Dashboard: Before: Flat, noisy metrics → After: Focused progress view with career goals and weekly milestones

---

## 6. Usability Testing Insights
**Insight cards (quote, impacted area, resulting design change)**
- "I didn’t know where to start—everything felt generic." – Area: Personalization – Change: Added clear first milestones and example micro-assignments
- "I wanted to show my best work but didn’t know what recruiters want." – Area: Portfolio – Change: Added structured templates and prompts to capture outcomes
- "Mentors felt distant; I needed credibility signals." – Area: Mentor Discovery – Change: Added endorsements and portfolio tethering for trust
